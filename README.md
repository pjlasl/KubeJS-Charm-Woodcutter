# KubeJS-Charm-Woodcutter
These are independent scripts that add recipes to Charm's Woodcutter block.

Choose the script according to the Mod Loader (Fabric or Forge) and the mod you may have installed.

## Which files should I use?

Charm.js and Minecraft.js are scripts you should load regardless of the Mod Loader you have installed.
You can then chose the javascript file based on the mod you have installed.

  - Terrestria
