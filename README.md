# KubeJS-Charm-Woodcutter
Several scripts for KubeJS that allow for other mod wood types to be used inside Charm's woodcutter

This started out as just a simple project to allow Logs to be added to the cutter and I expanded it to allow for other mods to be used.

All the files are independent of each other. Chose the file that matches the mods you have installed.

## Instructions

### Dependents

To use these you need the following mods installed

1. Charm
2. KubeJS

These should be downloaded from CurseForge. Follow the installation instructions for each mod.

### Using the scripts

Download the scripts of your choice and add them to the /server_scripts directory under KubeJS

Start the game and world of choice

### In Action

With the Charm Woodcutter GUI open place a log or plank variant and see the items displayed.

Have Fun!
